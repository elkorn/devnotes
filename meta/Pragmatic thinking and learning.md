Questions helpful in getting a bigger perspective and testing the understanding of a mental model:
 - How do you know?
 - Says who?
 - How specifically?
 - How does what I'm doing cause you to... ?
 - Compared to what or whom?
 - Does it always happen? Can you think of an exception?
 - What would happen if you did (or didn't)?
 - What stops you from...?

 If you think you've defined something, try to also define its opposite. Contrast a behavior, an observation, a theory with its exact opposite- *in detail*.

# Learning Deliberately

## SMART objectives

_SMART_ stands for **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant and **T**ime-boxed.

A *goal* is a desired state that you are trying to reach, presumably in a short time.

An *objective* is something you do to get closer to the goal.

1. Narrow the objective down ("_I want to be able to write a web server that server dynamic content in Erlang_" vs. "_I want to learn Erlang_").
2. How do you know when your done? _Measure_. It is easy to measure something concrete, using actual numbers. If you think you cannot measure an objective - **go back to point 1**.
3. Make the next objective attainable from where you are _now_. An unachievable goal is not a reasonable target, rather a frustration.
4. Is it relevant? Does it float your boat? Do you have control over it? If not, then it _is not relevant_. Drop it.
5. Give yourself a deadline, so that the goals do not float around, constantly being pushed aside by everyday matters. Be reasonable about deadlines - _small steps assure frequent success_ which translates to frequent motivation stimulation.

Consider the broader context while setting goals and deadlines. Some solutions might work short-term but only so.

### My SMART objectives

By sunday evening(02.06.2013):
1.  I will scaffold an AngularJS application template for KMS. I will use transclusion.
2. I will solve one downloaded dump for 70-486.
3. I will read and make notes from all the lingering opened browser tabs.
4. I will complete, print out and somehow frame the weekly review process template.

## Pragmatic Investment Portfolio
Model your knowledge portfolio with the same care as you would a financial investment one.

You cannot relegate learning activities to "free" time. Free time really does not exist. Time can only be allocated, not created or destroyed.

### Having a plan
It is __extremely__ important and helpful to have a plan. It needs to be as concrete as possible, and with a timeframe. It needs to specify:
 - things to do Now (the next possible action),
 - Goals for next week/month/year,
 - Goals for five weeks/months/years out.
The timeframe can be different, depending on the context and environment (fast/slow moving industry, difficulty of the topic etc.).

### Diversification
Just as in financial portfolio mgmt, it's about risk vs return. Also, diversification can keep things fresh, keeping you more easily engaged. Mix languages, environments, techniques, industries and non-tech areas (mgmt, public speaking, art, economy...).

.NET is low-risk, low return. Haskell may be the next big thing. All knowledge investments pay off in some way, providing added value.

### Active investment
Cyclically revise the viability of your portfolio in the cold light of day.
 - Is it performing as expected?
 - Has the environment changed? (market, technologies, big players etc.)
 - Is there anything that needs to be added/removed?
 - Do the objectives need to be revised or the goals changed?

### Investing regularly
_Dollar-cost averaging_. Invest small amounts of time on a regular basis - create a ritual. 

Plan what to do before you sit down so that when the time comes, you can get right to it.
