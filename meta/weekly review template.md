## 1. Collect, Process and Organize Papers and Physical Items

Gather all accumulated paper-based materials in front of you and then individually process and organize each item. 
After a decision has been made about each paper item, if it must be kept, it is scanned to digital format 
and dropped into Trello. Then all paper items are discarded via trash, recycling or shredding. 
Areas and items to check include:

 - Physical Inbox (home and office)
 - Wallet
 - Briefcase
 - Backpack
 - Business Cards
 - Receipts
 - Postal Mail

### 2. Process and Organize All Digital Inboxes
Process and organize all digital inboxes.  Each inbox must be processed to ZERO in order to complete Step 2.

 - Gmail Inbox (personal email)
 - Outlook Inbox (work email)
 - Trello Inbox
 - Telephone Memos
 - Text Messages

## 3. Process and Organize All Social Inboxes
Login to social networks to check for communications that need follow up and processing.

 - LinkedIn (Notifications, Invites, Messages)
 - Facebook (Notifications, Messages)
 - Twitter (Interactions, Direct Messages)

## 4. Review Previous and Upcoming Calendar Data

Open up all calendar systems and look back through previous seven days and forward to the next seven days. 
Notes and actions should be processed and then organized to proper place in your system.

Review All Calendar Events from Previous Week (Note in detail any action items, reference data, etc. - record in Trello)
Review All Upcoming Calendar Events for Next Week (Note in detail any to-do items to prepare for meetings,
individuals to contact for information, etc.)

## 5. Empty Your Head
Collect any uncaptured new projects, action items, waiting-for’s, someday-maybe’s, etc.
Add them to the Trello Inbox and don’t worry about processing them yet.

## 6. Review Lists
Look through all active project files to process and organize accordingly.

Evaluate status of projects, goals and outcomes, one by one, at each of the levels of being to ensure at least one
current action item is on each list.
Make sure each next action is really a next action and write it as if I were delegating it to someone.
Browse through project plans, support material & any other work-in-progress material to trigger new actions,
completions, waiting-for’s, etc.
Review for any projects which may now have become active, and transfer to “Projects.” Delete items no longer
Assign time to any critical projects on the calendar

## 7. Get Creative
Document any new, wonderful, creative, thought-provoking, risk-taking ideas into your system.

Take 15 minutes to just actively brainstorm and dream up new projects you would like to tackle down the road.
Review creative brainstorm thoughts from last week.  Any that you could take action on? Move to _“Someday, maybe”_ list?
