## Sebastian Thrun on the Universal Law of Innovation: Build It, Break It, Improve It

The overall goal should be a moonshot - aiming above what seems reasonable.

A team should have autonomy- there is no bigger performance and creativity killer than micromanagement.

Failure should be celebrated - the process of learning and creation is based on building, failing and improving. The essence of the idea is to **fail fast**.

### Discussion and ideas vs execution

Times when you reach success are the times when you have a clear-cut goal and just strive to achieve it without arguing and 
constantly rediscussing the possibilities. In the long run, you have to start DOING stuff to achieve success. All good projects are comprised of 2 or 3 good ideas. Too many ideas can be the death of a project. Also, the ideas ought to be derived from a problem in the project field.

Discussion should be continued up until the point of setting the first milestone.

It is not really about the ideas- they are always there. 95% of success is getting the ideas to come to reality is to physically execute them.

Reasoning by logic vs reasoning by analogy - if you think purely logically how a thing should work, devoid of any analogies to existing stuff, you will come to radically different conclusions.

### Starting a company vs mountain climbing
Some people start companies to get reach. This is like climbing a mountain to stay on top of it for a long time.

What really matters is the process. You have to enjoy the climb and pick a mountain that you like climbing.

There is also no route up to the top of the mountain - you need to mark it yourself. Setting very clear, achievable milestones is extremely important in this case.
Trust is crucial- you need to be able to trust your team blindly and vice versa.

You may not always see the summit of the mountain- but it is there. It is an unmovable entity, yet the path leading to it can change during the journey.
The only decisive power you have during the realization of a project is how to lay out the path to the goal every day.
