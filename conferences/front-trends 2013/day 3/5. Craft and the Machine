What do you want? 
And why do you need it?
Nobody will come to you with explicit information regarding how to create a product.
You need to extract that info from them.
Investigation, then producing. It is important to demarkate the 'turning of the creative corner'.

1st order problems:
 - infrastructure
 - tools
 - needs

2nd order problems:
 - community
 - play
 - wants

An important question to ask is whether the product will solve 1st order or 2nd order problems.
Finding out which type of problems you like working on is a step toward career happiness.

Trends matter more while dealing witth 2nd order problems. Our natural inclination is to go with the group. Creativity demands the oposite. Look at the status quo and then try to imagine the opposite.

The feeling of "we can do it now" often indicates scratching at a first order problem, it is not a product in itself.

“Question the itch. Question your motivation.”
and:
“Are we doing it just because we can, now?”

Rejecting real-time
 - blink and you miss it

question the context - personal (do your friends like the songs that are being played on their computers) and physical (do you have yuour audio plugged in) context matters a lot.

Style used to express the character of things.

"Question the opposite - you might create something new that meets emerging desires."
"Sexy defaults are really important for users."
