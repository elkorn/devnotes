Using style guides makes work flow faster.
Fighting within a team is only causing dealys and is purely destructive.
Work things out.

Social belonging - a natural drive to belong within a group. Whatever you think of another person, focus on what you can learn from him instead of hating.

Style guides help maintain the product better and improve readability and understanding - that contributes to reducing the time needed to introduce new people to a project.

Build components, component libraries etc. - contextlessly defined elements seem to be the way forward.

Make the components just good enough to work across your whole domain with little modification.

Try to be friends with your coworkers- you all want to get the best result and that is the highest, common goal.
