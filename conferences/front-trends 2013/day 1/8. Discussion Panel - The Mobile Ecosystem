How much space is there in moble market as of now to be taken by new players?
A lot - if you are able to  make a difference or introduce a radically different mobile OS, different from Apple's or Google's.

Monetization of HTML5 apps is still more difficult than that of native software. In these terms the open web is still behind.
The standards required for HTML5 to be a full contender in the market are still in development (e.g. W3C drafts for identification, payments)
Still, HTML5 is the best we could come up with in terms of cross-platform applications.
