Touch event - 300-500ms delay
Extra touches are not forgotten
Co-opt with touch events with JS
1. Accept input
2. Provide user feedback!!! The user cannot be waiting for extensive amounts of time without any notification.
3. Update the UI

Battery life
---

The website cannot be the reason of battery drain.
Use jpegs, pngs and not gifs
 - minimize the DOM
 - avoid reflows and repaints ( read up on causes)
 - no JS animations
 - do you really need a library/framework?
 - use darker colors

Latency
---

 - reduce the number of DNS lookups and HTTP requests
 - don't redirect
 - use data URIs
 - use sprites
 - leverage localStorage

Memory
---

 - mobile browsers crash completely when the device runs out of memory
 - gzipping is not enough
 - use ImageAlpha, TinyPNG and PNG8 format
 - reduce image size
 - server the right imagees
    - media queries etc.
    - tools (sncha myimage)
    - <picture>
    - srcset attribute
    - clown car technique   (media queried background-images)
    - use icon fonts when possible
    - css masking (background-image + -webkit-mask)

Fonts
---

 - font squirrel -> expert -> custom subsetting -> select characters.
 - use icons, not images or external fonts
    - CopyPasteCharacter
 

Alpha transparent effects are not rendered as a static bitmap and are evaluated on each repaint.

Large gradients requiire CPU to create and are stored in memory. Images often render faster than gradients.
Keep gradients small!
TRANSITIONS require reflows, TRANSFORMS do not.
Don't use animations under box-shadows- this could cause huge amount of calculations .
