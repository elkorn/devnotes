Revolutionized gov.uk sites, simplicity and whitespace is a key.

2000 websites replaced with 1, provding users with a predictable experience, making the govt more transparent and saving backend money. Robust, coherent experience.

Talking about User Experience is fuzzy. Talk about fonts, images, colors, whitespace etc. Stick to concretes! UX is everyone's responsibility - everyone within the team is a contributor to the end effect.

Better for users or GTFO.

1. Start with user needs.
2. Do less.
    - does not mean "work less", but "focus".
    - if something does not get stuff done, GTFO with it.
    - less is more, due to providing clarity.
3. Design with data.
4. Do the hard work to make it simple.
    - make the amount of user thinking and work a minimum
    - simplicity should be an element of every part of the end result
5. Iterate A LOT on features.
    - MVP (minimum vialbe product) -> alpha -> beta -> live
6. Build for inclusions.
    - user research > academic ideas

7. 
    - 
    - design in browser
    - jekyll + heroku = easy, sharable prototypes

8. Build digital services, not websites.
    - websites are a part of thing that people are doing - not THE destination
    - 
9. Be consistent, not uniform.
10. Make things open, it makes them better.
    - be a team player, acknowledge other people.
