Well, don't use pixels in border-radius. Ems, % etc.
The rounding values for each corner are being "normalized" and scaled down in case of values that exceed container sizes. It is for that the radii do not overlap.

border-radius: horizontal / vertical;
half-circles, quarter-circles: use x x x x / x x x x radii.
The declarations on the side of the '/' are treated individually like full declarations - also in terms of shortcutting (e.g. 100% 5% 50% 50% / 100% 40% 20% )
- check out the presentation source !!!

box-shadow: 0 0 0 <length> <color> inset/outset -> outline emulation.
