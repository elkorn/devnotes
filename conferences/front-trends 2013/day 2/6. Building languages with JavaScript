High level steps for building a compiler:
 - define language syntax
 - generate a parser
 - instrument parser to build an AST
 - generate JS from the AST

 LLJs is between asm.js and JavaScript, looks a bit like C.
Floop for .y and .l for grammars, jison for AST generation, and the nmapping the AST to JS counterparts.
Useful for DSL creation in JS.
