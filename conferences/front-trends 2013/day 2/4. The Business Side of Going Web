This talk is about creative agencies.

 - Strong brand
 - If 'everyone' is the target audience - RUN.
 - Choosing something new requires some thought due to the fact that it will be your legacy code (obvious...)
 - SaaS web shop - caution the "new and shiny" - don't give in to hype temptations.
 - While choosing a tech stack - robustness is key.
 - XCode
 - Do not make the app look like a website, make it stand out visually and behave just like the user would expect it to.
 - Freelancing considerations:
    - Time == money
    - Deal with new and shiny - if a client wants new techs and do not know what they are talking about, it's better to convince them of a better alternative. If they seem to have a grip, work on it with them.
 - Even open source projects need to be 'sold' intellectually- docs, tutorials and information are crucial.
